Quick Install

    1. Untar or unzip the distribution (be sure to unzip the subdirectories):
       tar -xzvf krecipesweb_x.x.x.tar.gz in your webserver's document root.
       If you don't have direct access to your document root, put the files in
       a directory on your local machine, and, after step 3, transfer the
       directory on your web server using, for example, ftp.
    2. Ensure that all the scripts have the appropriate owner (if PHP is running in
       safe mode, having some scripts with an owner different from the
       owner of other scripts will be a problem).
    3. Open the file config.php in your favorite editor and change the values
       for $dbhost, $dbuser, $dbpass and $dbname to fit your
       environment.  Here,  "$dbhost" means the MySQL server.
       Then edit the site settings below in the same file with the values for
       $site_title, $site_lang, $url, $admin_mail and $mtable_width
       ($mtable_width is optional).
       And then the rest of the values in config.php
    4. Open the file <www.your-host.com>/<your-install-dir>/index.php in your
       browser. Krecipes Web Frontend should now display the categories in your
       database.
